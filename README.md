# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
# select-react-by-mariem

This project is a React component to create a custom select dropdown.

There are different parameters as props:
- id (String): ID name for the select,
- options (Array): array of selectable options (a list element is created for each option in array),
- abbreviations (Boolean): true if options are objects with name and abbreviation properties / false if option array is simple

If the array of options has objects with abbreviations, get only the name as title and only the abbreviation as value (which can be saved in Redux). This allows to have a simple array (no objects) as 'options' too.

Before any selection, the displayed option on text button is the first option of options' array.
A "value" attribute has been created on text button (which has the id) to easily get the selected option value.

If the button is clicked, the options list is shown and each option is accessible with keyboard.
If an option is selected/clicked, the text button is updated and the options list is hidden.

## Installation

In your project directory, you can run the following command to install the npm package:

```sh
npm install select-react-by-mariem
```

## Import and use

In your React component or page, you can import the React component from the installed npm package:

`import Select from 'select-react-by-mariem';`

Then, you can use your imported component, for example:

`<Select id="YOUR_ID" options={YOUR_OPTIONS_ARRAY} abbreviations={false} />`




Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
